SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
Problem Statement:
Build a medicine availability tracker for rural pharmacies.

Solution:
Database Management: Design a database to store information about medicines, including availability, stock levels, expiry dates, and pharmacy details.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface accessible via web or mobile platforms for pharmacists to update stock levels and for users to check medicine availability.
Search Functionality: Implement robust search capabilities so users can quickly find pharmacies that have specific medicines in stock, possibly including filters by location, medicine name, or category.
Real-time Updates: Use technologies that allow real-time or near-real-time updates of medicine availability to ensure accurate information for users.
Notifications: Provide a notification system for pharmacists to alert users when stock levels are low or when a medicine is out of stock.
Security and Privacy: Ensure data security and privacy compliance, especially when handling sensitive health information.
Integration: Consider integrating with existing healthcare systems or databases to streamline data sharing and improve accuracy.
Feedback Mechanism: Include a feedback mechanism for users to report inaccuracies or provide reviews, which can help improve the system over time.
Scalability: Design the solution to be scalable so that it can accommodate a growing number of pharmacies and users over time.
Training and Support: Provide training and ongoing support for pharmacists to use the system effectively, especially in areas where digital literacy might be a challenge.
